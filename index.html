The first I heard of the Beach was in Bangkok, on the Ko Sanh Road. The Ko Sanh Road was backpacker land. Almost all the buildings had been converted to guest houses, there were long-distance telephone booths with air-con, the cafes showed brand-new Hollywood films on video, and you couldn't walk ten feet without passing a bootleg tape stall. The main function of the street was as a decompression chamber for those about to enter or leave Thailand; a halfway house between East and West.

The map was beautifully colored in. The islands' perimeters were drawn in green ink, and little blue pencil waves bobbed in the sea. A compass sat in the top right-hand corner, carefully segmented into sixteen points, each with an arrow tip and appropriate bearing. At the top of the map it read, "Gulf of Thailand," in thick red marker. A thinner red pen had been used for the island names. It was so carefully drawn that I had to smile. It reminded me of geography homework and tracing paper. A brief memory surfaced of my teacher handing out exercise books and sarcastic quips.

The journey from the train station at Surat Thani to Koh Samui passed in a sleep-fogged blur. I vaguely remember following Etienne and Francoise onto the bus at Donsak, and my only memory of the ferry ride is of Etienne shouting in my ear over the boat's engines. "There, Richard!" he yelled, pointing over the horizon. "That's the Marine Park!" A cluster of blue-green shapes was just visible in the distance. I nodded obligingly. I was more interested in finding a soft spot on my backpack to use as a pillow.

Lightning silhouetted the line of palm trees on the beach into a line of claws with pencil arms. The lizard scuttled out of my hand, startled by the flash.

Think about a lagoon, hidden from the sea and passing boats by a high curving wall of rock. Then imagine white sands and coral gardens never damaged by dynamite fishing or trawling nets. Freshwater falls scatter the island, surrounded by jungle - not the forests of inland Thailand, but jungle. Canopies three levels deep, plants untouched for a thousand years, strangely colored birds and monkeys in the trees.

At first glance the camp was close to how I'd imagined it might be. There was a large dusty clearing surrounded by rocket ship trees and dotted with makeshift bamboo huts. A few canvas tents looked incongruous, but otherwise it was very like a kind of Southeast Asian village I'd seen many times before. At the far end was a larger construction, a long-house, and beside it the stream from the waterfall reemerged, bending around to run along the edge of the clearing. From the straightness of its banks, it had obviously been deliberately diverted. 

It doesn't matter why I found it so easy to assimilate myself into the beach life. The question is why the beach life found it so easy to assimilate me.
